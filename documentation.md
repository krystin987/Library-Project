This is a digital library with front end graphical user interface and local browser storage capabilities. It will accept data that represents books and store them as a whole library that is searchable and manipulatable as well as retaining the information in the browser when the page is closed or reloaded. Users may search in a few ways, add new book information with inputs, remove book information based on title or author, or receive random suggestions.

The Library loads with all available books in the Library displayed on screen. The search is immediately accessible, it will show only books that match the input by title or author. Users may choose from 9 additional options, rendered as buttons in the navigation section of the page. Each button changes display to show the appropriate option.

All methods used should display some feedback, through visual display on the webpage. Removing books from the library based on author name does not provide visual feedback in the current version.
